Use Metapic to tag images, create collages and link products from our service.

== Description ==

Use Metapic to tag images, link content and create image collages through the WordPress editor.
The links created with our editor are connected to our product feed allowing you to make money from the traffic generated from these links.

Major features in Metapic include:

* Automatically checks all post content for links that can be converted to Metapic links (needs to be activated on the options page).
* Our custom editor fully integrated in TinyMCE for tagging images and linking content.
* A collage editor for making composite images with your favorite products.
* A stat summary on your dashboard.
* A more detailed custom statistics view for your account showing you all the traffic generated for your links.

PS: You'll need a [Metapic account](http://metapic.se/) to use it.  Metapic is a free service and all you need to do is register in order to use the service.
Metapic reserves the right to contact you for more personal details in order to facilitate payouts for the traffic you generate.
